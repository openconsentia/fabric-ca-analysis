# Overview

The objective of this project is to provide a demonstrator for anyone interested in [Fabric CA][1] appreciate its features and functionalities.

## Prerequisite

You are expected to be familiar with the operations of `docker` and `docker-compose`.

## What is in this project?

Clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/openconsentia/fabric-ca-analysis).

In the repo, you will find the following artefacts:

* Docker-compose based deployments of [Fabric CA][1] with custom instrumentations located in this folder [./deployments/docker-compose.yaml][4];

* A set of [bash shell scripts](https://github.com/openconsentia/fabric-ca-analysis/blob/master/deploymentss/scripts) to help you interact with the [Fabric CA][1] deployments.

## How to use this project?

Please refer to scripts found in [./deployments](https://github.com/openconsentia/fabric-ca-analysis/blob/master/deployments) to get information and learn about the orchestration and the operations of [Fabric CA][1] using docker. Then use the demonstrator together with the [official operational guide](https://hyperledger-fabric-ca.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/operations_guide.html) to conduct experiement.
 
Out of the box, the project provides scripts to perform operations to:

* spin up a local network;

* maniuplate the [Fabric CA Client][2];

* manipulate the [Fabric CA Server][3].

#### Spin up a local network

Use this [./scripts/network.sh](https://github.com/openconsentia/fabric-ca-analysis/blob/master/scripts/network.sh) to operate your local network of [Fabric CA][1] and supporting containers. 

Run the following commands:

* `./scripts/network.sh run` to spin up a local network.

* `./scripts/network.sh stop` to stop a running local network.

* `./scripts/network.sh status` to view the status of the containers in your network.

* `./scripts/network.sh clean` to remove docker containers and images from your machine. 

You will also find this script [./scripts/crypto.sh](https://github.com/openconsentia/fabric-ca-analysis/blob/master/scripts/crypto.sh). This script is used to generate TLS certificates that you can use to demonstrate secure communications between the server and client.

When you spin up the local network, an openssl based certificate is also generated which you will find the folder named `./deployments/crypto` -- autogenerated. Please study the network orchestration file named[./deployments/docker-compose.yaml][4] to appreciate the steps involved in configuring a TLS enable communication.

#### Manipulate the [Fabric CA Client][2]

Run the command `./scripts/shell.sh client` to access, via bash shell, the container of [Fabric CA Client][2] in your network.

Please click on the link in the sidebar named `Client` for more information about using and orchestraing the server component.

#### Manipulate the [Fabric CA Server][3]

Run the command `./scripts/shell server` to access, via bash shell, the internals of [Fabric CA Server][3] in your network.

Please click on the link in the sidebar named `Server` for more information about using and orchestraing the server component.
